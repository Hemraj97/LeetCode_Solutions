Time Complexity.
whenever in loop multiplication or division factor is there..the complexity generally turns out to be O(logn) with base 2.
eg binary search.
Big O - upper bound.
Omega - lower bound.
Thetha -  tight bound,bound Big O and Omega.
In recursion, if there are two recursive calls in the function, the complexity is O(n^square).
